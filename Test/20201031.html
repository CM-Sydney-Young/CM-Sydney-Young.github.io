			My name is Chih-Mei Young. I was born and raised in Taichung, Taiwan. The simple but sound microscope experiment kit I received as a 10th birthday gift from my parents was the start of my lifelong passion for science and research. Recalling the first time when I conducted chemical experiment to synthesize a small piece of soap in a high school chemistry course, I was impressed by the saponification reaction arising from the hydrolysis of a carboxylic acid ester under basic conditions. Since then, whether manufacturing processes of soap and other chemical products are similar or not to the experimental procedures conducted in laboratory has greatly drawn my attention. It was the yearning to figure out the differences between experiment and mass production that encouraged me to choose Chemical Engineering as my field of study.
