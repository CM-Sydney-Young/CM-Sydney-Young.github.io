				At the beginning of 2020, an unknown threat to human’s health emerged in China
				and soon spread to the entire globe rapidly. A new type of coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, is highly contagious and causes serious respiratory disease, which has so
				far killed thousands of people in more than 200 countries. Moreover, the
				accompanying shrinking production and consumption has led to the largest global
				recession since the Great Depression. As experts are still looking for solutions, we
				could learn a lesson from the history of humankind, which is never short of examples
				of worldwide epidemics, although it is not very likely to be successful.
