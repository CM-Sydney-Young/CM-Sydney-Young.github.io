					My name is Chih-Mei Young. I was born and raised in Taichung, Taiwan. The simple but sound microscope experiment kit I received as a 10th birthday gift from my parents was the start of my lifelong passion for science and research. Recalling the first time when I conducted chemical experiment to synthesize a small piece of soap in a high school chemistry course, I was impressed by the saponification reaction arising from the hydrolysis of a carboxylic acid ester under basic conditions. Since then, whether manufacturing processes of soap and other chemical products are similar or not to the experimental procedures conducted in laboratory has greatly drawn my attention. It was the yearning to figure out the differences between experiment and mass production that encouraged me to choose Chemical Engineering as my field of study.

					I have accomplished my bachelor’s degree study in 2018, master’s degree study in 2020 and now pursuing doctoral study in Chemical Engineering at National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan. In professor Hsin-Lung Chen’s Polymer Physics lab, the focus of my graduate research is to investigate the complexes of PAMAM G4 dendrimer and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), where I have learned to employ small angle X-Ray scattering (SAXS) and cryogenic electron microscope (cryo-EM) to probe the self-assembled structures of the complexes. In addition to experimental methods, MATLAB programming was adopted to fit the SAXS diffraction patterns obtained from experiments with the patterns calculated from proposed models. This study not only resolves the complexation mechanism and the interplay among various free energy components, but also provides controllable structure transitions of PAMAM G4 dendrimer-SDS complexes, which is valuable for further applications, such as nanopatterning and the construction of templates for nanoporous materials. Recently, I have worked with professor Hsin-Lung Chen to investigate dendrimer-induced DNA compaction via experimental and computational methods, such as SAXS, small angle neutron scattering (SANS) and molecular dynamic simulation in GROMACS, hoping to discover a novel biomimicry of histone protein.

					Alongside my academic performance, based on my current ability to give something back to the society, I have volunteered to lecture basic science concepts and instruct high school students in conducting simple science experiments in Future Engineering Lab, Shi Yuan Senior High School from 2014 to 2017 and to hold a six-day high school camp in cooperation with Chemistry Outreach Team, Otago University, New Zealand in 2017. In these activities, I simplified the complicated science concepts into more comprehensible explanations in order to evoke high school students’ interest in science.

				<p>
					As starting up my own business and inventing products or even opening up a new industry that is beneficial to the society has been one of my long-term future plans, I have been endeavoring to consolidate the fundamentals, which enables me to exploit rigorous chemical engineering skills, concepts, and knowledge more cleverly to achieve this goal.

					我是楊知玫，我在台灣台中出生和成長。我於2018年完成學士學位研究，於2020年完成碩士學位研究，現在在台灣國立清華大學化學工程專業攻讀博士學位。

					在陳信龍教授的高分子物理實驗室中，我的碩士研究主要是探討PAMAM G4樹狀聚合物與十二烷基硫酸鈉（SDS）的錯合物，在這裡我學會了使用小角度X射線散射（SAXS）和低溫電子顯微鏡（cryo-EM）探測配合物的自組裝結構。除實驗方法外，還採用MATLAB編程將實驗獲得的SAXS衍射圖與擬議模型計算出的圖進行擬合。這項研究不僅解決了複雜機制和各種自由能組分之間的相互作用，而且還提供了可控制的PAMAM G4樹狀聚合物-SDS錯合物的結構轉變，這對於進一步的應用非常廣泛，如建構奈米圖形和奈米多孔材料模板。最近，我與陳信龍教授合作，通過實驗和計算方法，例如SAXS，小角度中子散射（SANS）和GROMACS中的分子動力學模擬，研究了樹狀聚合物誘導的DNA摺疊，希望發現一種新穎的組蛋白仿生方法。

					除了我的學業表現，基於我目前能夠回饋社會的能力，我於2014年至2017年間在西苑高中未來工程實驗室講授基礎科學概念並指導高中生進行簡單的科學實驗。並於2017年與紐西蘭奧塔哥大學化學拓展小組合作舉辦了為期六天的高中訓練營。在這些活動中，我將復雜的科學概念簡化為更容易理解的解釋，以喚起高中生對科學的興趣。
				</p>
				<p>
					發明產品甚至開闢一個對社會有益的新產業是我的長期未來計劃之一，因此我努力鞏固基礎，這使我能夠更巧妙地利用化學工程技能，概念和知識實現這個目標。
