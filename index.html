					My name is Chih-Mei Young. I was born and raised in Taichung, Taiwan. The simple but sound microscope experiment kit I received as a 10th birthday gift from my parents was the start of my lifelong passion for science and research. Recalling the first time when I conducted chemical experiment to synthesize a small piece of soap in a high school chemistry course, I was impressed by the saponification reaction arising from the hydrolysis of a carboxylic acid ester under basic conditions. Since then, whether manufacturing processes of soap and other chemical products are similar or not to the experimental procedures conducted in laboratory has greatly drawn my attention. It was the yearning to figure out the differences between experiment and mass production that encouraged me to choose Chemical Engineering as my field of study.

					I have accomplished my bachelor’s degree study in 2018, master’s degree study in 2020 and now pursuing doctoral study in Chemical Engineering at National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan. In professor Hsin-Lung Chen’s Polymer Physics lab, the focus of my graduate research is to investigate the complexes of PAMAM G4 dendrimer and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), where I have learned to employ small angle X-Ray scattering (SAXS) and cryogenic electron microscope (cryo-EM) to probe the self-assembled structures of the complexes. In addition to experimental methods, MATLAB programming was adopted to fit the SAXS diffraction patterns obtained from experiments with the patterns calculated from proposed models. This study not only resolves the complexation mechanism and the interplay among various free energy components, but also provides controllable structure transitions of PAMAM G4 dendrimer-SDS complexes, which is valuable for further applications, such as nanopatterning and the construction of templates for nanoporous materials. Recently, I have worked with professor Hsin-Lung Chen to investigate dendrimer-induced DNA compaction via experimental and computational methods, such as SAXS, small angle neutron scattering (SANS) and molecular dynamic simulation in GROMACS, hoping to discover a novel biomimicry of histone protein.

					Alongside my academic performance, based on my current ability to give something back to the society, I have volunteered to lecture basic science concepts and instruct high school students in conducting simple science experiments in Future Engineering Lab, Shi Yuan Senior High School from 2014 to 2017 and to hold a six-day high school camp in cooperation with Chemistry Outreach Team, Otago University, New Zealand in 2017. In these activities, I simplified the complicated science concepts into more comprehensible explanations in order to evoke high school students’ interest in science.

					As invent products or even open up a new industry that is beneficial to the society is one of my long-term future plans, I am endeavoring to consolidate the fundamentals, which enables me to exploit rigorous chemical engineering skills, concepts, and knowledge more cleverly to achieve this goal.
